## Overview
This project provides an **end-to-end solution for detecting hate speech** in text data. It encompasses everything from data preprocessing and model training to deployment, making it a comprehensive toolkit for anyone looking to implement hate speech detection in their applications. The goal is to create a robust system that can identify and flag harmful content, contributing to safer online environments.

## Features
* **Data Preprocessing:** Robust cleaning and preparation of text data for optimal model performance, including tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
* **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or a deep learning approach like LSTMs/Transformers - *specify your model here if known*) to accurately classify text as hate speech or non-hate speech.
* **Model Training & Evaluation:** Includes scripts for training the model on a labeled dataset and evaluating its performance using relevant metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
* **Web Interface:** Offers a user-friendly web application (e.g., built with Flask or Streamlit) for real-time hate speech detection. Users can input text and get instant predictions.
* **API Integration (Optional):** Designed for easy integration into other applications via an API endpoint.
* **Deployment Ready:** Includes necessary configurations (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `Procfile` for Heroku/render.com) for seamless deployment.
